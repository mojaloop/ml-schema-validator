Shared Joi validation code for Mojaloop services

Contents:

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Tests](#tests)

## Usage
The library supports both Joi validation >= version 17.
To use the library you can import it into your project

## Tests

Currently test coverage will automatically pass at 100% because these are just objects, I would always suggest creating a JSON and create a test against the schema if you are contributing. Both positive and negative scenarios 

Running the tests:

    npm run test
    npm run test:unit
    npm run test:coverage
    npm run test:coverage-check
        
Tests include code coverage. See the test/unit/ folder for testing scripts.

## Auditing Dependencies

We use `npm-audit-resolver` along with `npm audit` to check dependencies for vulnerabilities, and keep track of resolved dependencies with an `audit-resolve.json` file.

To start a new resolution process, run:
```bash
npm run audit:resolve
```

You can then check to see if the CI will pass based on the current dependencies with:
```bash
npm run audit:check
```

And commit the changed `audit-resolve.json` to ensure that CircleCI will build correctly.
